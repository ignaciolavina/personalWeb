LH APP

Two attempts...


Some years ago I realized about the necesity of a software solution for managing the sport center where I was working. [At that time the company didn't have any kind of software for managing the bookings, meaning some ineficiences and innecesary time spent on repetitive task that could be automatizated]

That year I started my new studies, a double degree in informatics engineering and business administration, and started to learn my first Object Oriented programming languaje.

The union of that two facts gave as a result the decision to "learn by doing", making a new personal project, the LH APP, a web application for managing the sport center. 

FIRST ATTEMPT
Sep 2015 – Jun 2016

On this first attempt, I started the project with the 

 On my first year of the Informatics degree, I decided to learn a programming language by starting a personal project. The project consisted in one application for managing the sports club where I was working.

 At the beginning I didn't have any axperience on programming or projects management. 

Failure causes:
- Wrong language code chosen (Java)
- Absence of knowledge about version management (Git, Subversion or others)
- Abscence of project tracking and flow
- Unorganized documentation process.
- Inexperience

Outcomes:
- More than 10 thousand lines of code.
- A lot of documentation and Ideas.
- Experience and knowledge.

- An honnor mention in the programming course.


SECOND ATTEMPT
sept 2017 - February 2018

Afther the first failure and a couple of years of the project [proyecto guardado en el cajón] I decided to retake the project. This time I joined a group of five university students, and do it in web programming.

Again the project result on a new failure experience, but once more with a loot of new learnings as outcome and positive expereience:

Failure causes:
- Lack of time. Most of the team members were on the last year of studies, with a lot of courses (as it is a double degree) and some of them started to work. This had as a result the incapacity of a continuous work flow
- Scheduling problems. The group was diverse, two components had class on the morning sesion for the university classes, other two had afternoon sesion and the last one was studing on USA. This made difficult to have team meetings and work togehter.


Outcomes
- Learings and experience on web programming.
- Lot of documentation and code.
- Great team experience.


At the momment I,m writting this article the project has been stored again in the [cajón] with many other personal projects and ideas for develope, but I'm sure one day It will be retaked.
