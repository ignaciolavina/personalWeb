					<p>Some years ago I realized about the necessity of a <strong>software solution</strong> for managing the sports center where I was working. At that time the company was starting and didn't have any kind of software for managing the bookings, the shoop, and other business issues, meaning some inefficiencies and unnecessary time spent on repetitive tasks that could be automatized.</p> 
					<p>That year I started my new studies, a double degree in informatics engineering and business administration, and started to learn my first Object Oriented programming language.</p> 
					<p>The union of that two facts gave, as a result, the decision of "<strong>learn by doing</strong>", making a new personal project, the <strong>LH APP,</strong> a web application for managing the sports center.&nbsp;</p> 
					<p><br></p> <p>
					<strong>FIRST ATTEMPT</strong><br>
					Sep 2015 – Jun 2016</p> 
					<p>On this first attempt, I started the project with the&nbsp;idea of learning the <strong>Java programming </strong>language. The motivation behind was that I had a programming course at the university about Object Programming language, which was driven in Java. </p> 
					<p>Since it was my first programming language, I was a <strong>newbie </strong>and I haven,t any kind of programming background, so it was a real challenge to try this with no knowledge at all. Also at that time, I didn't know about the existence of any kind of <strong>version control</strong> like Git or Subversion, so when I finalized, the code was a mess. I have lots of code copies in folders with many version names (yes, exactly what you are thinking). When I discovered Git was incredible, I still wonder how many problems and hours of work I would be saved.</p> 
					<p>Hey! but not everything was negative! The experience for me was <strong>awesome</strong>, and I had many great outcomes: A lot of Java Knowledge, an Honor mention on the Programming course, and lots of code, documentation and great ideas.</p> 
					<p>Here are the main learnings about that project:</p> 
					<p><strong>Failure causes:</strong></p> 
					<ul> 
						<li>Wrong language code chosen (Java).</li> 
						<li>The absence of knowledge about version management (Git, Subversion or others).</li> 
						<li>The absence of project tracking and project flow.</li> 
						<li>Unorganized documentation process.</li> 
						<li>Inexperience.</li> 
					</ul> 
					<p><strong>Main outcomes:</strong></p> 
					<ul> 
						<li>More than 12 thousand lines of code.</li> 
						<li>A lot of documentation and Ideas.</li> 
						<li>Experience and knowledge.</li> 
					</ul> 
					<p>An <strong>Honor mention award</strong> in the programming course.</p> 
					<p></p> 
					<p><strong>SECOND ATTEMPT</strong><br> 
					sept 2017 - February 2018</p> 
					<p>After the first failure and a couple of years with the project stored on my desk, I decided to retake the project. This time I decided to join a group of five university students, and instead of Java do it in web programming, (make sense, isn't it?).</p> 
					<p>Again the project resulted in a new failure experience, but once more with a lot of new learnings as outcome and positive experience:</p> 
					<p><strong>Failure causes:</strong></p> 
					<ul> 
						<li>Lack of time. Most of the team members were on the last year of studies, with a lot of courses (as it is a double degree) and some of them started to work. This had, as a result, the incapacity of a continuous workflow</li> 
						<li>Scheduling problems. The group was diverse, two components had class on the morning session for the university classes, other two had afternoon session and the last one was studying on USA. This made difficult to have team meetings and work together.</li> 
					</ul> 
					<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p> 
					<ul> 
						<li>Learnings and experience on web programming.</li> 
						<li>A lot of documentation and code.</li> 
						<li>Great team experience.</li> 
					</ul> 
					<p></p> 
					<p><strong>Why writing this post?</strong></p> 
					<p>The reason of this post is simple, to remind me (and you if you still reading this) that it doesn't matter if you fail because you will learn a lot in the process. Also try to know always why did you fail, and what are the main outcomes of that.</p> 
					<p>And of course, encourage you to have always a personal project on dev, whatever the topic it is.</p> 
					<p>At the moment I,m writing this article the project has been stored again in with many other personal projects and ideas for develope, but I'm sure one day It will be retaken.&nbsp;</p>
